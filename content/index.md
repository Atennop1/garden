# atennop

This is my own digital garden, idea of which was shamelessly stolen from [y9san9](https://y9san9.me).

Few core things about me:
- I am really passionate about programming and tech in general
- I write code since I was 12yo
- I moved from gamedev to backend
- I use Debian and NeoVim, btw

You can find more useless info [[verbose|here]].
