## Projects

### In backend

- [[.|blog]] – this website where I share random notes with world
- [Friendly CLI](https://github.com/friendly-social/cli) – client for Friendly social network
- TBA trading project

I moved to backend not so early so there is not much to share _yet_.

### In gamedev
- [**Genesis**](https://github.com/Atennop1/Genesis) – my own 2D OOP game engine in C++
- [**ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine**](https://github.com/Atennop1/ArkanoidWithoutAnEngine) – a game built fully from scratch with it
- [**UnrealShooter**](https://github.com/Atennop1/UnrealShooter) - my first project created with Unreal
- [**Relational-Databases-Via-OOP**](https://github.com/Atennop1/Relational-Databases-Via-OOP) – experimental library for working with databases in OOP style
- [**SavannaSprint**](https://github.com/Atennop1/SavannaSprint) – my first released game (2021, Google Play)

Those are completed and actually useful or really meaningful projects I am proud to share. But there are also a lot of
other little stuff in my archived GitHub repos.

## Work Experience

- **BigTech** (someday)
  <br>I wanna move from gamedev on C# / C++ to backend in Go and be hired as Middle engineer by the beginning of my second
  year in university.
- **Learning and making personal projects** (2021 - present)
  <br>I was learning gamedev, first Unity and then Unreal Engine, and later decided to move to backend ([[content/field_switch.md|here]] is why), so official start of my
  career is delayed second time, which obviously makes me sad.

## Education

- **Master's Degree** (someday - someday + 2)
  <br>My dream is to move to USA and apply for Master's, preferably in Stanford University. I don't have any ideas how I will manage to do this yet.
- **Bachelor's Degree** (2025 - 2029)
  <br>Software Engineering at [FinUniver / ФинУнивер ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_University_under_the_Government_of_the_Russian_Federation) ([[content/university_choice.md|here]] is explanation of my choice)

## Languages 

- **English** (Fluent): _everybody speaks that_
- **Russian** (Native): _mother tongue_

## Political Views

I stand for free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views. 
I believe that someday it will stop being my dream and become a reality.
